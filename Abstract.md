# Abstract:
 
Within the context of professionals working in Government Relations, the recognition of
parliamentarians in physical environments is an essential task. These professionals carry out an
activity that brings to parliamentarians the interests of the categories that lobbyists represent,
that is, one of the processes that ensure democracy for our country. The traditional form of
recognition used is made by printed frames that the professional has to walk in his hand to
identify (recognize) the parliamentary authority. One solution to this task is to seriously use
computer vision techniques to help identify, quickly and accurately, an authority in an event
that circulates dozens or hundreds of people.
Studies on computer vision are recent, in the 70s two works were precursors - The
Psychology of Computer Vision and A framework to represent knowledge. From 2012 with
the victory of the ImageNet computer image recognition contest, Alex Krizhevsky from the
University of Toronto with a neural network called AlexNet opened the frontiers for advances
in neural network models and hardware with NVIDIA GPU architectures (today the GPU is
available to any user of the Google Colab platform). Innovations like these were instrumental
in making it accessible for anyone to develop facial recognition solutions on their home
computers. This technical study presents the use of libraries such as Dlib and OpenCV, which
simplifies the development of applications to train a model with images of federal deputies, for
example, and offer a tool for lobbyists to stop using frames with the image and name of
parliamentarians (“Carômetro”) printed on paper and start using Deep Learning technological
solutions within the reach of lay people.
